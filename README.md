# Hello, GitHub!
Hey there, my name is Luka! Currently, I am a college student at Goucher College majoring in computer science and data science. My main area of interest is AI, Machine Learning and Robotics (software side).

## What I am currently learning and working on:
- Machine Learning using Tensorflow.
  - Compiling code on a remote SBC.
  - Initializing environments using Docker containers.
  - Object detection of US electrical outlets.
- Virtual Robot Developement using ROS2 Foxy.
  - Currently on hold due to school prioritization.
- Git Workflow.
  - Creating readable documentation.
